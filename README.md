# Nand2Tetris
Another Nand2Tetris course's implementation, base on the book introduced in course.

Items:
- [x] Assembler
- [x] VM
- [ ] Compiler
- [ ] OS (in term of this book)
- [x] ALU in System Verilog
- [ ] Computer in System Verilog
- [ ] Emulate Screen and Keyboard connected to System Verilog's simulator (use Verilator)

Decided to the system in FPGA. Somehow it's becoming my experience of iCE40-Hx8k FPGA in spare time :D.
