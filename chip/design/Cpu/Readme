CPU architecture

This is comprised of following blocks:
- IfId : Instruction fetch Instruction Decode
- Mr   : Memory read to read data from source M
- Mw   : Memory write to write data to destination M
- Ss   : Source select to select source data to input of Alu
- Alu  : Alu block
- Cc   : Cpu control which contains all built-in registers as well as PC control

Sample data flow:
There are 2 pc values to IfId from Cc: pf_pc and pc. IfId will fetch instruction at pf_pc first then hold it stand at output.
