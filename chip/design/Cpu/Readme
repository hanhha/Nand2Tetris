CPU architecture

This is comprised of following blocks:
- If  : Instruction fetch
- Id  : Instruction Decode
- Mr  : Memory read to read data from source M
- Mw  : Memory write to write data to destination M
- As  : Alu source select to select source data to input of Alu
- Alu : Alu block
- Cs  : Completer source select to select source data to input of Cc
- Cc  : Completer control - Cpu control which contains all built-in registers as well as PC control

To simply the protocol and get low latency, interface between IfId, Mr, Mw with downstream memory is declared as below"
- Request channel:
  Output : cs (chip select), wr (write), adr (address), wdat (write data), wstrb
  Input  : wait
  Requirement: if cs asserted while wait asserted, then wr, adr, wstrb and wdat must be stable. Downstream can assert wait while using cs, wr, adr, wdat, wstrb for preparing its resource.
- Response channel:
  Input  : rdat (read data), err (error)
  Requirement: must be available at next cycle after request channel with wait deasserted.

Instruction flow:
1 - IfId:
  - Decode instruction and output source info, destination info.
- If source
