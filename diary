Aug 21 - Aug 23, 2019: Finished reading book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles".
                       Audit the course Nand2Tetris part II. I planned to start the software phase first since I have another plan for hardward.
Aug 24, 2019: 1:30 AM, I was very thrilled about this project. I was installing icarus verilog and verilator as well to prepare for implementing the machine in this book using Verilog and simulate it with software not using the book's tool suite. 
              Turned back to software and finished Hack assembler (written in Python).
